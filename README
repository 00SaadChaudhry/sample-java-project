This is just a reference for setting up a new Java project. It
contains some of the little Ant tricks I've learned.

You will need to have Astyle installed and in your path for the
"format" target to work. If it's missing, that's fine. It won't affect
any other targets.

Ant will be looking for Checkstyle, which provides the "check"
target. Except the extra target, I think it should work without
it. Like a hardcore bureaucrat, Checkstyle will harshly criticize your
code, requiring you to add every bit of excessive and needless
boilerplate. That can keep some idle hands pretty busy.

I hate coding absolute paths in my build script and I hate including
built files as part of the base project. My philosophy is that the
*environment* should be set up so that the tool can easily find the
external resources they need (JUnit, etc.) from the system, not within
the project. It's the system that provides the libraries. Anyone who
has the proper development environment set up -- one that carries
across many projects -- should be able to clone the repository and do
the build without editing anything or installing anything else into
the project space.

This is just a reference for setting up a new Java project. It
contains many of the little Ant tricks I've learned over the years.

I hate coding absolute paths in my build script and I hate including
built files as part of the base project. My philosphy is that the
*environment* should be set up so that the tool can easily find the
external resources they need (JUnit, etc.) from the system, not within
the project. It's the system that provides the libraries. Anyone who
has the proper development environment set up -- one that carries
across many projects -- should be able to clone the repository and do
the build without editing anything or installing anything else into
the project space.
